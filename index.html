        <h2>Vishane Stubbs</h2>
        <p>I am an outspoken, scholarly, industrious, and rational thinker in my final year at the
            University of the West Indies, Mona Campus. My ambition is to receive a well-rounded,
            highquality education in order to nurture my talents and abilities, ultimately, making a
            significant contribution to the field of engineering. I am now working on a bachelor's degree
            in software engineering while also considering a minor in chemistry to widen my knowledge
            base.I am interesed in Web Development as it gives another dimension to programming and it simply looks very cool.</p>
